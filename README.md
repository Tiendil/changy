# Changy

Simplest changelog manager, oriented to human editing, not to special message formatting in commits and tags.

Inspired by [Changie](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie) but simpler, oriented to editing text files, no special cli commands to input changes, no special changes format for unreleased changes.
